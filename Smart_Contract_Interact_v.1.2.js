//This code is written in JavaScript and utilizes the ethers.js library to interact with an Ethereum smart contract. It implements a few functions that allow a user to mint an AlumDAO Test Score Token, set account access permissions, and check if they own an AlumDAO Test Score Token. Here is a breakdown of each part of the code:

//Connecting to the web3 provider:

const web3Provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
This line creates a new instance of the Web3Provider object from ethers.js, which allows the application to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

//Connecting to the deployed contract:

const contractAddress = "<INSERT CONTRACT ADDRESS HERE>";
const contractABI = [
  "<INSERT ABI HERE>"
];
const accountBoundNFTContract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, web3Provider);
//These lines specify the address and ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the deployed smart contract, and create a new instance of the Contract object from ethers.js that represents the deployed contract. This allows the application to call the smart contract's functions and retrieve data from it.

//Getting the user's Ethereum wallet address:

async function getWalletAddress() {
  const accounts = await ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
  return accounts[0];
}
//This function uses the ethereum.request method to prompt the user to connect their Ethereum wallet to the application, and then retrieves the user's wallet address.

//Minting a new AlumDAO Test Score Token:

async function mintNFT() {
  const walletAddress = await getWalletAddress();
  const isAllowed = await accountBoundNFTContract.isAllowed(walletAddress);
  if (!isAllowed) {
    alert("Account not allowed to mint NFT");
    return;
  }
  const tx = await accountBoundNFTContract.mint();
  await tx.wait();
  alert("NFT minted successfully");
}
//This function calls the isAllowed function from the deployed smart contract to check if the user is allowed to mint a new NFT. If the user is allowed, it calls the mint function from the smart contract to mint a new NFT for the user. The tx.wait() method is used to wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain before displaying a success message to the user.

//Setting account access permissions:

async function setAllowed() {
  const account = document.getElementById("allowedAccount").value;
  const allowed = document.getElementById("allowedCheckbox").checked;
  const tx = await accountBoundNFTContract.setAllowed(account, allowed);
  await tx.wait();
  alert("Account access updated successfully");
}
//This function retrieves the account address and access permission settings from the user interface, and calls the setAllowed function from the deployed smart contract to update the account access permissions. The tx.wait() method is used to wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain before displaying a success message to the user.

//Checking if the user owns an AlumDAO Test Score Token:

async function hasNFT() {
  const walletAddress = await getWalletAddress();
  const balance = await accountBoundNFTContract.balanceOf(walletAddress);
  if (balance > 0) {
    document.getElementById("nftStatus").innerHTML = "You own the AlumDAO Test Score Token";
  } else {
    document.getElementById("nftStatus").innerHTML = "You do not own the AlumDAO Test Score Token";
  }
}
//This function calls the balanceOf function from the deployed smart contract to check the user's balance of AlumDAO Test Score Tokens. If the user owns at least one NFT, it updates the HTML element with id "nftStatus" to indicate that the user owns the AlumDAO Test Score Token
